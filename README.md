# Chess-engine
K-art is free chess engine software, and distributed under the MIT License. Essentially, this means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program, including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download from your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute K-art in some way, you MUST always include the full source code, or a pointer to where the source code can be found, to generate the exact binary you are distributing.
